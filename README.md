Created a remake of the command line utility Grep, it searches plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression. The current version of this remake can search through a variety of files and can contain an additional parameter -c for the count or the number of times the target string was found and also includes the -L parameter which includes the line numbers for where the line was found in the file. It also includes the file name for each line that it is found in. It prints the target string in red, the text file name in blue and the occurences for when -c is entered in yellow. It was created in C and originally intended for learning purposes. Graze over the code and hope you enjoy what you see!
